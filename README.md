# Terraform AWS S3 Bucket module
This module creates a simple S3 bucket to host a static website which will be linked to a corresponding domain.

This variable can be set for the module:
- `bucket_name`: name of the bucket to host the static files.

**Note:** the policy file needs to be updated according to the bucket/domain which will be used.
